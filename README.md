# <Horiseon refactor>


## Description

This project introduced the use and differentiation of the sematic html terms Header, Nav, Main, Article, Section Footer and Aside.
In addition spent more time getting comfortable with the command line interface and understanding git commands and file structure.
A challenge this project presented was understanding why only the readme would publish. It was realized the index was buried a few layers deeper.
